# Waggle
A realtime intra application communication network.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Installation requires that you have node installed and are running at least version 0.10.31, redis is also required

```bash
brew install nvm redis
```
```bash
nvm install 0.10.31
```
```bash
sudo npm install -g nodemon
```

### Setup

```bash
git clone ssh://git@g.it.symphony.local:2222/sym/waggle.git
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Developing

Working with waggle is relatively easy, you just need to make sure you have the installation prerequisites installed and the following running:

* redis-server ```redis-server --loglevel=verbose```
* nodemon (from the root directory) ```nodemon```

It is also a good idea to have the following running in a terminal as it will give useful information for errors and troubleshooting.

* redis monitor ```redis-cli monitor```
